# ZhaoBigHomo
ZhaoBigHomo(ZBH) is a humorous simple programming language that attempts to be memory-unsafe, type-unsafe and weird. It is an assigment from Prof. Zhao in lecture _ICS Practise_. The homo in title is actually an unofficial abbreviation for "homework".

# How it works
The language ZBH will be compiled to a specified instruction set defined by our Prof. Zhao: the ZhaoBigAss (Note the Ass here means Assembly). Then another interpreter will interpret the fake assembly and run the code. 

# Build
Maybe just let CMake do its job? IDK.

# Features
- ✔️ Direct memory access and modification! Who care about memory-safety when it comes to freedom?
- ✔️ OOP support with the ability to change the class of any object during runtime! Why not release the full power of vtables?
- ✔️ Too many ways to write code that works not as intended! Time to write code that only you know the meaning!
- ✔️ All type-checks are warnings! In ZBH, type-safety are just spices, and should not be the main dish.
- ✔️ Jump to any function, code, or even some random location in the code with ease! It's all about freedom!
