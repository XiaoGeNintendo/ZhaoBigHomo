# ZhaoBigHomo
ZhaoBigHomo(ZBH) is a simple programming language that attempts to be memory-unsafe, type-unsafe and weird. It is an assigment from Prof. Zhao in lecture _ICS Practise_. The homo in title is actually an unofficial abbreviation for "homework".

# How it works
The language ZBH will be compiled to a specified instruction set defined by our Prof. Zhao: the ZhaoBigAss (Note the Ass here means Assembly). Then another interpreter will interpret the fake assembly and run the code.
